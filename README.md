These maps show the mean Sea Surface Temperature (SST, degrees Celsius) and SST anomaly from the latest 7 days of data.
Two datasets are shown here for comparison - MODIS-Aqua daytime SST provided by NASA, and NCDC Optimal Interpolation gap-filled data. Data is accessed via the NOAA CoastWatch ERDDAP server.

## MODIS-Aqua:

The left plot is 7-day mean day-time SST, and right is the 7-day anomaly, when compared to the climatology of mean SST from 2003-2020 during the same week. The third map shows the number of times a given pixel had data in the most recent week.

##### Number of observations in current week:

## NCDC OI SST:

The left plot is 7-day mean daily SST, and right is the 7-day anomaly, when compared to the climatology of mean SST from 1991-2020 during the same week. The contour on the anomaly map corresponds to pixels that exceed 1.29 times the standard deviation of the climatology for that period.
